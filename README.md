# Description

the project has been developed and styled using React , react-query for state management and
axios for server side communication

starting by designing all necessary pages based on requirements , developed all necessary services ,
integrate the services in their respective Pages

# Challenge

Once the User Logs in  , the landing page doesn't fetch the products automatically, it consider as if
no one is logged in , but once I manually refresh the page , the products get fetched.. this is one point i 
like to improve in the future

# Interesting Codes

I Like the way i do my form refactoring (FormButton , FormInput ,Error and Success messages, .......) it makes the form short and clean

and the way react-query handles the mutations..
